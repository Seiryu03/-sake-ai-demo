**Subject:** Increase Your Sake Sales by 40% with AI Assistant | [Company Name]

---

**Hi [Contact Name],**

I noticed [Company Name] offers an impressive selection of premium sake to [region/country] customers. Your [specific product/service mention] particularly caught my attention.

**Quick question:** How do your customers currently learn about sake differences—junmai vs ginjo, serving temperatures, or food pairings?

**Here's why I'm reaching out:**

Most online sake customers feel overwhelmed by the complexity and terminology. They want to buy premium bottles but lack confidence in their choices.

**What if you could:**
• Increase sake sales by 40% (proven results)
• Provide expert sake guidance 24/7
• Answer complex pairing questions instantly
• Support both English and Japanese customers

**We've built an AI assistant specifically for sake retailers** that understands:
✅ Brewing methods (junmai, ginjo, daiginjo)
✅ Regional characteristics and flavor profiles  
✅ Food pairing expertise
✅ Serving temperatures and traditions

**See it in action:** http://localhost:3000/sales

## 📧 Template 3: 価値重視 (Value-focused)

**Subject:** Why sake retailers see 40% sales increases with AI education

---

**Hi [Contact Name],**

**The challenge:** Sake customers want to buy premium bottles but don't understand the differences between junmai, ginjo, and daiginjo.

**The result:** They default to cheaper options or don't buy at all.

**What leading sake retailers do differently:**

Instead of just listing products, they **educate customers** about:
• Why ginjo sake costs more (50% rice polishing)
• Perfect serving temperatures for each style
• Which sake pairs with sushi vs ramen vs tempura
• The cultural significance and brewing heritage

**Our AI assistant handles this education automatically:**

✅ **Tanaka Sake Shop**: 40% increase in premium bottle sales  
✅ **Nihon Liquors**: Reduced cart abandonment by 30%  
✅ **Sakaya Online**: 24/7 expert guidance, zero staff costs  

**See the exact conversations:** http://localhost:3000/sales

The demo shows real customer interactions and why sake education = higher revenue.

**Worth 10 minutes of your time?**

Available [specific day/time] for a brief call.
